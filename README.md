Every time you have to beat 3 enemies. Also you can shoot in cactuses and a bird (but it will be a little surprise for you;)). After 6 shots you need to reload a gun by push "R".

In a addition, you see your health score in a right corner. When the score falls to 0 - the game finishes. You lose.

If you kill all your enemies, you are a winner!
